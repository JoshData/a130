## **Oversight**

The Director of OMB shall use information technology planning reviews, fiscal budget reviews, information collection budget reviews, management reviews, and such other measures as the Director deems necessary to evaluate the adequacy and efficiency of each agency's information resources management and compliance with this Circular.

The Director of OMB may, consistent with statute and upon written request of an agency, grant a waiver from particular requirements of this Circular. Requests for waivers must detail the reasons why a particular waiver is sought, identify the duration of the waiver sought, and include a plan for the prompt and orderly transition to full compliance with the requirements of this Circular. The Director will publish a list of waivers granted at https://a130.cio.gov/, or any successor website, in tabular form, each waiver with its corresponding waiver request or an explanation why the waiver request is not published.
